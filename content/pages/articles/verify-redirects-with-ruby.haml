Summary: When you have many redirects to test, automate it with ruby and typhoeus

%h1 Using Ruby to check redirects

While writing the script, I first stared out with net/http. This was going pretty slow and when I had 1900+ urls to verify, I calculated it would take approximately 2 hours to complete. While that was acceptable I found out that a lot of links were broken which translated into running this script more than 10 times to re-verify. So I did some searching around and found the gem "typhoeus". Very cool gem indeed. This made things go much faster. I included both snippets of code in my script to show progression and for note gathering.

Here is my code:

= print_code(:syntax => 'ruby', :filename => 'files/check_redirection.rb', :theme => 'eiffel', :show_code => false)
